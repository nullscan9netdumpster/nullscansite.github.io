                    <h4>AI Models Keep Getting Smarter</h4>
                    <p>
                        Large language models and generative AI tools are rapidly evolving, powering
                        everything from coding assistants to creative tools. Companies and open-source
                        communities are racing to make models more efficient, controllable, and private.

                    <h4>Cybersecurity Remains a Top Priority</h4>
                    <p>
                        With more services moving to the cloud, protecting data, identities, and
                        infrastructure has become critical. Zero-trust architectures, stronger
                        authentication, and better monitoring are now standard for serious deployments.

                    <h4>Edge & Cloud Working Together</h4>
                    <p>
                        Modern apps increasingly blend edge devices with powerful cloud backends.
                        This allows low-latency experiences while still leveraging heavy compute for
                        analytics, AI, and storage.

                    <h4>Open Source Tools Everywhere</h4>
                    <p>
                        From dev tooling to security scanners and observability platforms, open source
                        projects continue to define the modern stack. Self-hosted tools give developers
                        more control over their workflows and data.
